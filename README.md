# HABITAT ECOLOGY BRANCH

Our Habitat Ecology team focuses on scientific research and monitoring of interactions among organisms, habitats, and their environments to determine how habitat impacts NOAA's trust resources. We are keenly interested in determining how environmental change like habitat loss, habitat restoration, alteration of salinity patterns, and climate change are impacting the relationships between organisms and their essential habitats. This includes analyses of patterns in organism presence-absence, density-biomass, growth-mortality, production, abundance\--distribution, genetics, and immigration-emigration. Our research and data collection facilitate the adaptive management of marine and coastal ecosystems covering a broad range of habitats including coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, and Spartina marshes.

## First Steps

-   Go to the Link provided and start thinking of what you'd want shared of your project. Send me those files and pictures for a trial run.

-   Once this GitHub Action is loaded by R and runs everything, we can just edit and add files in the browser. We can click the Actions tab to watch the progress. This is a common workflow once we have a site developed and we just need to do a quick update.

or Edit locally using RStudio

-   By sending a request to IT through emailing .

### Building the website

### Customizing is next

-   `index.Rmd` will be the front page. You can change the layout by changing `postcards::trestles`
-   Edit `_site.yml` to change the top navbar
-   Add pages like `Page1.Rmd` and then add those to `_site.yml`
-   Add your images (like logos) to `images` and a favicon to `favicon.ico`
-   Push your changes back up to GitHub and the GitHub Action will rebuild the website.
